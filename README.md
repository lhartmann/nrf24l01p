# nRF24L01p
Portable C++ library for Nordic's RF modules.

My attempt at a fully function nRF24L01p library. 

Should be compiled as C++, althugh not object oriented.

Portability is implemented via a hardware abstraction layer. Proper HAL should be selected via command line defines to prevent unnnecessary code edits. Check nrf24l01p.h for the macro names.

LICENSE: Latest GNU Lesser GPL. (You may use the code for whatever purpose, but any changes to the library itself must be published.)
